In my 3D scene project, I followed a comprehensive design process that involved detailed planning of system architecture and component integration. This project sharpened my skills in handling complex systems and optimizing graphical elements for realistic rendering.

I developed the program through a cycle of design, implementation, testing, and refinement, learning to effectively manage and update software components for better performance and scalability.

Throughout the project, I embraced modular programming and iterative development, refining graphical elements like texture mapping and lighting to enhance the scene's realism and performance.

Studying computer science has equipped me to tackle complex problems creatively, preparing me for advanced roles in game development and virtual reality. This project also deepened my understanding of computational graphics, enhancing my skills in graphical programming and system optimization, which are valuable in both my academic and future professional endeavors.
